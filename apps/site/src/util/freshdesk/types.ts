/**
 * Types for the Freshdesk ticket forms API response.
 *
 * These mirror the shape returned by:
 *   GET /api/v2/ticket-forms/{id}
 *   GET /api/v2/ticket-forms/{id}/fields/{field_id}  (for fields with choices)
 *
 * Only the fields we actually use are typed — the full API response
 * includes additional agent-facing properties we don't need.
 *
 * Freshdesk field types fall into two categories:
 *   - default_* — system fields that map to top-level ticket properties
 *     (email, subject, description, company). These exist on every form
 *     and cannot be deleted, only hidden.
 *   - custom_* — custom fields that map to the custom_fields object
 *     in the ticket payload, always prefixed with cf_ in the field name
 *     (e.g. cf_published_research_journal_name).
 *
 * The cf_ prefix is the reliable mechanism for determining payload shape
 * at submit time — see buildPayload.ts for how this split is handled.

export type FreshdeskFieldType =
  // --- Default system fields ---
  | 'default_requester' // Email address — maps to top-level `email`
  | 'default_subject' // Ticket subject — set programmatically, never shown to users
  | 'default_description' // Ticket body — maps to top-level `description`
  | 'default_company' // Organization — maps to top-level `company`
  | 'default_ticket_type' // Ticket type dropdown — maps to top-level `type`.
  // Uses choices[] from the per-field endpoint.
  // Can have dynamic sections attached to its choices.

  // --- Custom field types ---
  | 'custom_text' // Single-line text → TextField (usa-input)
  | 'custom_paragraph' // Multi-line text → TextareaField (usa-textarea)
  | 'custom_date' // Date → DateField (Trussworks DatePicker)
  // Uses Trussworks instead of raw USWDS because the USWDS
  // date picker requires DOM scanning for JS init, which
  // conflicts with React's client-side rendering in an island.
  | 'custom_dropdown' // Single-select dropdown → SelectField (usa-select)
  // Choices fetched via per-field endpoint at build time.
  | 'custom_checkbox' // Single boolean checkbox → CheckboxField (usa-checkbox)
  | 'custom_number' // Integer input → TextField with type="number"
  | 'custom_decimal' // Decimal input → TextField with type="number" + step="any"
  | 'custom_url'; // URL input → TextField with type="url" + URL validation

 * A single choice option within a dropdown or dependent field.
 *
 * Returned by GET /api/v2/ticket-forms/{id}/fields/{field_id} for fields
 * with type custom_dropdown, default_ticket_type, or nested_field.
 *
 * The choices array is recursive — each choice can have sub-choices,
 * which is how dependent fields (3-level hierarchy) are represented.
 * For flat dropdowns, choices[] on each item will always be empty.
 *
 * Note: In practice, label and value are often identical strings.
 * We use value as the submitted payload value and label as display text,
 * falling back to value if label is empty (as seen in test form data).
