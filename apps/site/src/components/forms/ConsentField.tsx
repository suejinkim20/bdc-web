/**
 * ConsentField
 *
 * A hardcoded consent checkbox rendered at the bottom of every form,
 * above the submit button. Not derived from Freshdesk field config —
 * this is a site-level requirement added by DynamicForm regardless
 * of what fields Freshdesk returns.
 *
 * Why hardcoded?
 *   Consent language is a legal/policy concern, not a support ticket
 *   field. It doesn't belong in Freshdesk's field config and shouldn't
 *   be editable there. It lives here so content changes go through
 *   the normal code review and approval process.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   - Required — the form cannot be submitted without checking this box
 *   - Checked state is registered with React Hook Form like any other field
 *   - The consent value is NOT included in the Freshdesk ticket payload —
 *     it's filtered out in buildPayload since it has no cf_ prefix and
 *     no matching default field type
 *
 * Copy note:
 *   The label text below is a placeholder. Final consent language should
 *   be confirmed with the content lead and legal/policy reviewer before launch.
