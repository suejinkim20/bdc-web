/**
 * errorMessages
 *
 * Single source of truth for all user-facing error and status strings
 * across all forms on the site. Centralizing these here ensures:
 *
 *   - Consistent wording across all field types and forms
 *   - Easy content review and updates without hunting through component files
 *   - A clear handoff point for the content team to review copy
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { fieldErrors, formErrors, formStatus } from '../copy/errorMessages'
 *
 *   Static message:
 *   required: fieldErrors.email.required
 *
 *   Dynamic message (takes a label):
 *   required: fieldErrors.text.required(field.label_for_customers)
 *
 * Tone guidelines (per UX spec):
 *   - Say what to do, not just what went wrong
 *   - "Please" is fine in moderation
 *   - Skip filler words: "Oops", "Uh oh", "Something doesn't look right"
 *   - Keep it short — a phrase, not a sentence, where possible
 *
 * Open questions:
 *   - Support email address for error fallback messages is TBD
 *     (see formErrors.submission.general and formStatus.unavailable)
 *   - Per-form success copy and button labels are defined per form, not here
 *
